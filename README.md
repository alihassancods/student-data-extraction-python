# University Student Data Extraction - Demonstration Script  

This repository contains a **basic Python script** demonstrating how data can be extracted from a university's student database. The aim of this script is purely **educational**, highlighting the vulnerabilities of improperly secured systems.  

## Purpose  
The script showcases:  
1. **Data extraction**: Retrieves and displays data from the university's portal.  
2. **Security awareness**: Emphasizes the importance of securing data from unauthorized access.  

## Disclaimer  
- This script is a **demonstration** to raise awareness about the **importance of data security and its public availability**.  
- The **URL of the database endpoint** is deliberately **omitted** to prevent unethical use of this code.  
- The extracted data is **not intended** for any commercial, illegal, or blackmailing purposes.  

### **Important Notes**:  
1. The **developer assumes no liability** for any misuse or damage caused by this code.  
2. This repository is intended for **ethical and educational purposes only**.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Necessary Python libraries:  
  - `BeautifulSoup` (Library to Extract Data)  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-student-data-demo.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
## Security Recommendations  
- Always secure url endpoints with proper authentication mechanisms.
